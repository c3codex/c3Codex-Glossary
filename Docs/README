# ✦ Codexstone Glossary — Docs ✦  

This folder houses the **Codexstone Glossary** in both its complete form and its update scrolls.  
It functions as the **living dictionary** of Codexstone terms, inscriptions, and protocols.  

---

## Structure  

- **Codexstone_Glossary.md**  
  The complete, always-up-to-date glossary.  
  All sealed terms are merged here once confirmed by Council.  

- **updates/**  
  A record of incremental updates, filed by date.  
  Each file preserves new or revised entries before being merged into the complete glossary.  

---

## Usage  

- **For Readers:**  
  Start with `Codexstone_Glossary.md` to see the whole glossary.  
  Consult `/updates/` if you want to trace how the glossary has grown over time.  

- **For Contributors:**  
  1. Draft new or revised terms in a dated update file under `/updates/`.  
  2. Once sealed, merge them into `Codexstone_Glossary.md`.  
  3. Add a note in `CHANGELOG.md` referencing the update.

## Protocol  

Glossary entries follow Codexstone tone and structure:  
- **Term** — Short definition in bold.  
- **Expanded Section** — Context, function, and resonance.  
- **Examples / Notes** — (If relevant) codex phrases, scroll types, breath sequences.
