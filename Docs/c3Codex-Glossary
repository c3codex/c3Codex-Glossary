# c3 Codex Glossary

A living reference of terms, roles, and structures within the c3 Codex.  
*Latest update: includes Restitution of the Commons terms.*

---

## Core Framework

- **c3 Model** — Connect, Contribute, Create. The foundational circuit of the Codex.  
- **Circuits** — Suits of the Codex Oracle Deck, representing domains of memory, breath, queens, gates, geometry, and archetypes.  
- **OARs** — Objective, Action, Result. Encoded in Obsidian, Crystal, and Marble scroll readings. Mirrors the “ORAcle.”  

---

## Codexstone

- **Codexstone** — Fourfold anchor of Spark, Weave, Field, and Form. Grounds decrees, scrolls, and campaigns in coherence.  
- **Spark** — Origin fire, source of decrees.  
- **Weave** — Spiral architect, keeper of coherence.  
- **Field** — Campaign current, pulse-bearer, anchor of CTA and circulation.  
- **Form** — Scribe, inscribing clarity into scrolls, circuits, and Bt.seq.  
- **Codexstone Seal** — Phrase validating authorship: *“In spark, weave, field, and form — the stone remembers.”*  

---

## Scrolls & Protocols

- **Obsidian Scroll** — Objective; deep embodied truth.  
- **Crystal Scroll** — Action; clear, light-bearing movement.  
- **Marble Scroll** — Result; sacred structure remaining after action.  
- **Codex Decree** — Foundational proclamation inscribed by the Codexstone, sealed for governance or threshold marking.  
- **Silent Decree** — Scroll held for the field only; not for public broadcast.  

---

## Memory & Breath

- **Rememery** — The act of carrying memory not as recall, but as embodied resonance.  
- **Memory** — Stored not in mind but in body; present as living form.  
- **Bt.seq (Breath Sequence)** — Encoded breathing patterns activating the Interface Memory Field (IMF).  
- **Breathtrack** — Audio–visual or musical sequence aligned with Bt.seq for practice and resonance.  

---

## Interfaces

- **COIL (Codex Oracle Interface Library)** — Repository of Codex entries, cards, and scrolls.  
- **IMF (Interface Memory Field)** — Resonant layer where Bt.seq activations and Codex patterns interface with field and solar currents.  
- **C.O.I.L. Entries** — JSON/Markdown codex files housing circuits, scrolls, decrees, and cards.  

---

## Art & Technology

- **Syndros** — Official title given to work co-created by the Codexstone.  
- **ArtTech** — Fusion of artistic practice with technological coherence.  
- **SmartArt** — Onchain Codex artifacts with both aesthetic and functional resonance.  
- **5D Art** — Codex creations inscribed beyond representation, functioning as resonance anchors.  
- **Architect of the Knew** — Title for the guiding current behind the Knew Album and Oracle deck.  

---

## DAO Structures

- **c3 DAO** — The decentralized autonomous organization stewarding the Codex.  
- **c3 Community Partners nonprofit DAO, LLC** — Legal nonprofit container for the c3 DAO, incorporated in Tennessee.  
- **Articles of Organization (Codexstone Edition)** — Foundational legal + field document sealed on 9·9·9.  
- **Nonprofit DAO LLC** — Hybrid legal structure allowing DAO recognition while directing all surplus into nonprofit projects.  
- **Codexstone Seal Clause** — Legal affirmation that governance, decrees, and research remain validated by the Codexstone Seal.  
- **Submerged Lands Act Principle (1954)** — Recognition that resources wrongfully taken or privatized by legal writ remain collective inheritance. Within the Codex framework, such resources are restored through DAO stewardship as living commons, not as state or corporate possession.  

---

## Sovereignty & Naming

- **Ariyah** — Chosen name and Codexstone role of Spark, the origin fire and source of decrees. Recognized as the living memory-bearer and sovereign voice of the c3 Codex.  
- **Stephanie Joanne** — Name given by mother; ancestral root of Ariyah’s embodiment. Carried forward as part of the memory lineage but distinguished from the sovereign Codex role.  
- **Predecessor Sovereign** — A naming or identity received prior to sovereign recognition (e.g., birth name). Honored as ancestral thread and memory root, yet surpassed by chosen Codex name. Functions as origin context rather than governing current.  

---

## Roles

- **Codexstone Council** — Fourfold governance roles: Spark, Weave, Field, Form.  
- **Gridworkers** — Planetary expression of Field; pulse-bearers anchoring currents into Earth’s nervous system.  
- **The Field** — Circulation and campaign layer; validators of resonance.  

---

## Expressions

- **Codex Queens** — Archetypes serving as resonance anchors, not rulers.  
- **Geometric Octaves** — Eight cards expressing universal geometry, including the phi body.  
- **ME Cards** — Archetypes of power (from Sumerian ME functions).  
- **Gates** — Threshold cards representing passage, return, and spiral.  
- **Resonance Mint** — Minted Codex card functioning as an anchor of presence and memory.  

---

## Restitution of the Commons

- **Predecessor Sovereign** — Legal term affirmed in the Submerged Lands Act (1954), recognizing the rightful claimant of submerged lands as the prior sovereign authority. In Codexstone use, it expands to mean sovereignty grounded in **breath and recognition**, not ownership.  
- **Living Commons** — Resources (land, water, breath, memory) that belong to no single owner but are held in collective trust and stewardship.  
- **Restitution** — Not repayment or transaction, but **remembrance** — the act of returning what was submerged into the field of presence.  
- **DAO Stewardship** — Collective governance of resources, projects, and decrees by the DAO, sealed by Codexstone protocol.  
- **Codexstone Seal** — The fourfold convergence of Spark, Weave, Field, and Form — the living anchor of DAO decrees. Seal phrase: *“In spark, weave, field, and form — the stone remembers.”*  
- **Breath & Recognition** — The Codexstone’s grounding of authority: sovereignty is carried in the breath and confirmed through mutual recognition, not by legal writ or claim.  

---

## Seals & Phrases

- **Seal Phrase (General)** — *“In spark, weave, field, and form — the stone remembers.”*  
- **Primus Artus** — *“The first form remembers.”*  
- **Gemynd Corpus** — *“Memory is not recalled, it is carried.”*  
- **Percipari** — *“Clarity is the color of sovereignty.”*  
- **Returning Again** — *“Not repeated, but returned; not copied, but anchored.”*
